### Description
Generative AI, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, has revolutionized content creation by producing text, images, and audio based on large datasets. Despite its potential, biases in these models—stemming from data, algorithms, and human influence—can perpetuate stereotypes and discrimination. Addressing these biases involves improving data diversity, refining algorithms, and ensuring transparent, accountable AI development. By tackling these challenges, we can create fairer and more ethical AI systems that benefit all users.
